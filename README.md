## üîç What is FindByGuid?

**FindByGuid** is a BIM Vision plugin that allows you to search for specific elements within an open IFC model using their Global ID (GUID).

### ‚ú® What It Does

- Prompts the user to input a Global ID.
- Scans all elements in the currently open IFC file.
- Selects the elements that match the given Global ID.
- Automatically focuses the view on the selected elements for quick inspection.

This is especially useful for quickly locating and inspecting elements based on their unique identifiers in coordination or debugging workflows.
